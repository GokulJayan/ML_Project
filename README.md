<h1>Event Summarizer with MOM (Minutes of Meeting)</h1>

<p align="justify">An automated audio processing and summarizing system that can process and summarize audio recordings effectively. The main aim is to provide an event
summarizer that automatically extracts important themes and significant text summaries from an audio recording, identifies speakers and their individual utterances with
timestamps, and more. This summarizer can help users discover particular audio segments using speaker identification and timestamps, as well as swiftly summarize audio using
major themes and text summaries. For making this web application, Assembly AI and Streamlit are utilized.<p>

<h3>Assembly AI</h3>
<p align="justify">In this project, audio processing and transcription were handled using the Assembly AI API. Speaker diarization, natural language processing, and audio-to-text transcription are
just a few of the cutting-edge audio processing techniques offered by Assembly AI.<p>

<h3>Streamlit</h3>
<p align="justify">We created a web application using Streamlit, an open-source Python framework for
creating interactive web applications, to provide our event summarizer a clear and
user-friendly interface. Users of the online app can submit an audio file, choose the
parameters for summation, and view the summary and speaker identification that results.<p>
